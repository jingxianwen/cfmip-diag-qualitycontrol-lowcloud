Follow 'Source', 'Browse' and 'QC_LowCld_ncl' directories to find a wiki where a brief description and example of each diagnostic plot is shown in a PDF. The diagnostic scripts, written in NCL, are found under 'trunk'. At the beginning of each script there is a description of file information required and a list of adaptations that need to be made.


There are two diagnostic scripts for the evaluation of low-level clouds and another two for general 'quality control'. I used the latter two to test CMIP5 model data which I downloaded. It may be of interest to some others using CMIP5 COSP output.


The observational data used in these NCL scripts can be found on the following web pages:

- OBS-4-MIPS (http://climserv.ipsl.polytechnique.fr/cfmip-obs/) for CALIPSO, CloudSat and Parasol.

- ERA-Int (http://data-portal.ecmwf.int/data/d/interim_moda/) for large-scale properties such as vertical velocity.

- CERES (http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/cmip5_data.php).


Model information used in the examples are from CMIP5 output.
