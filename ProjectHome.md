This project contains four diagnostic scripts which can be used to evaluate the representation of clouds, precipitation, cloud-radiative effects in climate models against CALIPSO, CloudSat, Parasol, and CERES satellite observations.

Each diagnostic, written in NCL, is presented briefly in a PDF.

These scripts are based on those presented in Nam and Quaas (J. Climate,2012) and Nam et al.(Geophys. Res. Lett.,2012).
